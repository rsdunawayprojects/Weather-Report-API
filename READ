**TO USE THE WEATHER API**

- When downloading the code, in your IDE, you firstly need to setup an acount to recieve an API Key to make the weather data calls
- Go to https://openweathermap.org/ and create an account
- On your account in the right corner (your username) click it and select "My API Keys"
- From there, generate an API Key for your Weather Data to be called and logged 
- Paste the API Key you generated in the API Key spot in-between the quotations, in the beginning, towards the top of the code



**TO CHANGE WEATHER LOCATION OF WEATHER API DATA**

- Lookup the longitude and lattitude Coordinates for the location you want the data to be pulled from
- Paste the Longitude and Lattitude Coordinates in the Code above the API Key portion



**CHANGE LOG FILE NAME FOR DATA RECORDED**

- In line 10, just change the .txt file name at the end to a different name corresponding to your location (or whatever you want to name it)
